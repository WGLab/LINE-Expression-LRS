1. Removed instances of inactive elements from the active elements regions. No instances of ORF2 overlapped with active elements. 

2. Removed instances of active elements and ORF2 elements from inactive regions. 

3. Inactive elements reference has “ L1 elements may have disruptions or mutations in one or both of their ORFs, rendering them non-functional“. So we can keep the ORF2 reference regions alone, and just remove them from the inactive reference. 
     bedtools intersect -a ../hsflnil1_8438_rm.bed -b ../hsorf2l1_8438.bed ../hsflil1_8438.bed -wa -v > inactive_no_ORF2_no_ACTIVE.bed


then sort the reference files: sort -k1V,1 -k2,2n inactive_no_ORF2_no_ACTIVE.bed > inactive_no_ORF2_no_ACTIVE.sorted.bed





Resulting Number of Regions in Each File:
   138 active_no_ORF2_no_INACTIVE.sorted.bed
 13292 inactive_no_ORF2_no_ACTIVE.sorted.bed
   108 orf2_original.sorted.bed
